## Problem Statement

The ORSP at the Illinois Institute of Technology faces challenges in handling a large volume of faculty inquiries regarding grant applications, procedural guidelines, and other research-related information. The existing communication channels are inefficient and lack the capability to provide timely responses to faculty members, leading to frustration and delays in the research process.

## Research Objectives

- Develop a sophisticated chatbot capable of addressing faculty inquiries regarding grant applications, procedural guidelines, and other research-related information.
- Improve accessibility to information and streamline communication channels for faculty members.
- Enhance operational efficiency at the ORSP by automating repetitive tasks and providing quick responses to inquiries.
- Contribute to the advancement of research initiatives at the Illinois Institute of Technology by facilitating smoother collaboration between faculty members and the ORSP.

## Methodology

The development of the chatbot followed an iterative process, starting with requirement gathering and analysis, followed by design, implementation, testing, and deployment phases. Agile methodologies were employed to adapt to changing requirements and ensure continuous improvement throughout the development lifecycle.

## System Architecture

The chatbot is built on a scalable and modular architecture, utilizing natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, machine learning models, and integration with existing ORSP databases and systems. The architecture ensures flexibility, extensibility, and reliability, allowing for seamless integration with future enhancements and updates.

## Development Phases

1. Requirement Gathering and Analysis
2. Design and Prototyping
3. Implementation and Coding
4. Testing and Quality Assurance
5. Deployment and Integration

## Evaluation Methods

The chatbot underwent rigorous testing and evaluation to ensure functionality, accuracy, and user satisfaction. User acceptance testing (UAT), performance testing, and usability testing were conducted to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.

## Recommendations

Based on the evaluation results and user feedback, the following recommendations are proposed for future enhancements:
- Integration with additional databases and systems to provide more comprehensive information to users.
- Implementation of advanced NLP algorithms to improve the accuracy and naturalness of conversations.
- Integration with external platforms and services to provide additional functionalities and services to users.
